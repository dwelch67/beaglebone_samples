First embedded BeagleBone example.

Since U-Boot has brought up everything, for example the uart, we dont
have to do that, later, but not just yet.  Likewise memory is up so
we can just use that as well.  This example runs out of ram and uses
the uart registers to print stuff out the uart then goes into an
infinite loop echoing whatever is typed in.

To run hit any key on boot to keep the board from going into linux
if you dont then reboot from linux or hit the reset button and try
again.

At the U-Boot prompt to load and run this program, if using minicom
I recommend running minicom from the directory where you build the
.bin file then you dont have to navigate very far

U-Boot# loady 0x82000000

You need to then use the commands of your terminal program to download
using ymodem.  Will leave that up to you (ctrl a then s for minicom)

when it finishes then

U-Boot# go 0x82000000

and it will run!

Press the reset button if you want to try again or do something else
