Simple timer based led blinker for the beaglebone.

Look at blinker01 for the basics of enabling the gpio and blinking the
leds.

This expands on blinker01 to use a hardware timer.  There are many
timers in this chip, as with the gpio you have to enable the logic block.
this example uses TIMER7.  The timer is used without a prescaler and
in an autoloading manner, basically looping around and around on the
counter.  The counter counts up, so taking a time stamp minus a prior
gives the time between time stamps.

The value used in the delay loop, 0x04000000 timer ticks produces a
tick rate such that the four leds go through their pattern every about
45 seconds.  Using the second hand of a watch.

Reading the users guide it says the TIMER clock source is or can be
the system oscillator, which is typically 24Mhz.  The schematic shows
24Mhz.  So (16*0x04000000)/24,000,000 = 44.7.  The 16x is because there
are 16 steps to the led pattern, and this measurement was taking over all
16 steps (all leds off to the next all leds off).

If that is really the clock source for the timers then the processor
clock which supposedly changes whether you power off of usb or the
dc power plug, wont affect the timer.
