Need a 3.3V TTL uart, search for FTDI 3.3v on ebay, or look for one of
the solutions for the raspberry pi.  search for ftdi at adafruit or
ftdi breakout or ftdi basic at sparkfun. (I only connect RX/TX but
also use the same computer to power the BBG and the ftdi board).

There is also a header on the bottom of the board if you have a
cable and uart solution for that.

Search for AM3358BZCZ100 at ti.com.

You need the technical reference manual.  Should get the datasheet as
well.

u-boot has obviously configured the uart, so writing to it as above
shoves an extra character out.  This is a good place to start.
