First embedded BeagleBone example.

Since U-Boot has brought up everything, for example the uart, we dont
have to do that, later, but not just yet.  Likewise memory is up so
we can just use that as well.  This example runs out of ram and uses
the uart registers to print stuff out the uart then goes into an
infinite loop echoing whatever is typed in.

Again we didnt have to init the uart, so we only need to talk to the
uart status and tx buffer registers.
