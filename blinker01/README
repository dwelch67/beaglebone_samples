Simple led blinker for the beaglebone.


Looking at the schematic we see that the leds are on signals named usr0
to usr3.

USR0 is connected to (V15) GPIO1_21, USR1 to GPIO1_22 and so on.

GPIO1 is not powered on by default and appears that uboot does not power
that gpio so we first have to feed it with clocks, then we can talk
to it.

The datasheet (AM335x) shows that for V15, the mode after reset is 7 and
that mode 7 for GPMC_A5 is gpio1_21, so unless uboot has changed this
we dont have to change the mode for the pin.

Not using a timer yet, just counting to a big number.  usb powered we
should be at 500mhz, dc powerd 780 or something.  So count to a big enough
number, the dummy() function is used to prevent the compiler from optimizing
the loop out completely.


As with the uart01 example, we can stop uboot from running linux and
load this program over the serial port.

U-Boot# loady 0x82000000
U-Boot# go 0x82000000
